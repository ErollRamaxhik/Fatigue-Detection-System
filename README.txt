The Fatigue Detection System (FDS) is a Program that detects the fatigue/tiredness of a vehicle 
operator and gives a warning before operator falls asleep. We aimed to prevent any possible 
damage caused by driver fatigue, both to the driver, and to the environment (other vehicles, 
pedestrians, etc.) The System aims to warn the Operator or to take the control of vehicle and to stop the vehicle safely.
The system was also built to be relatively inexpensive, 
and many parts such as the camera can provide high quality. Finally, 
the system was tested on multiple individuals in a laboratory environment, as well as at different light levels.
